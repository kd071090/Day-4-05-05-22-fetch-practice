# Practice: Working with Data, Fetching, and the DOM

Use this time to get more familiar with what we've covered so far using the activities below. You'll have all afternoon. If by the end of the afternoon you don't finish every task, that's alright. You can keep working on these on your own time.

Use the time this afternoon to collaborate and work together to pair program your way through the tasks and help reinforce each other's learning. Keep working together throughout!

## üëâ More about fetch - can you escape the earth? üöÄ

- Use our short videos [here](https://vimeopro.com/schoolofcode/fetch-videos/) (password: bootcamp), the [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch), and other online resources to explore more about the second argument of fetch.
- [Click here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2090159/TzRLkAk8) and follow the instructions and documentation. Make requests with `fetch` to the API endpoint to figure out the solution to the escape room. Can you escape the earth in time?

- ... and more! Google anything you're still unsure about.

Note: Resources you find online will often use the .then syntax, a way to deal with promises that came before async/await was introduced to JavaScript. If you encounter this, see if you can use your docs-reading muscles to translate the code into async/await!
